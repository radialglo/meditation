Meditation is a spin on the classic game of [Concentration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_\(game\)).
Match pairs of [Instagram](http://instagram.com/)  photos of the Japanese garden, [Sankei-en](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankei-en)
 while listening to beautiful pieces composed by the post-classical musician, 
[Olafur Arnalds](https://soundcloud.com/olafur-arnalds). Time to relax!

Created Winter 2012 by [Anthony Su](https://github.com/radialglo) for the [Coding for Good](http://cfg.good.is/) Challenge.
